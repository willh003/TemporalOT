# Quick Overview
- `gen_eval_results.py` to generate tables/plots for the Metaworld matched/mismatched results
- `get_training_curves.py` to generate training curves for tasks in the Metaworld matched/mismatched experiments
- `gen_random_mismatched_eval_results.py` to generate tables/plots for the Metaworld random mismatched ablation results (because the google sheet table setup is different)

# Folder
- `eval_path_csv/` stores the raw csv that you download from the google sheet
- `eval_agg_results/` stores the aggregated results for the experiments
    - `eval_agg_results/eval_training_curves/` stores the training curves for specific tasks
